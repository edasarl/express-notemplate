Version 0.1.8
=============

* Use html5 parser instead of node-htmlparser, because it correctly
  handles brackets in attributes values.
  Will probably switch to node-htmlparser2 or switch back to the default
  jsdom parser when this is fixed, see
  https://github.com/tautologistics/node-htmlparser/issues/2
  https://github.com/fb55/node-htmlparser/issues/14

Version 0.1.7
=============

* Bugfix disable completely jQuery.ajax and jQuery.globalEval,
  instead of buildFragment monkey patch that does work with jQuery 1.9.
* Depend on jsdom 0.5.x
* Refactor defaults options for jsdom window creation.
* Only one newline after doctype.

Version 0.1.6
=============

* Bugfix race condition loading scripts

Version 0.1.5
=============

* Bugfix $.each, not .forEach

Version 0.1.4
=============

* Use original jsdom 0.4.x.
* Use jquery 1.9.x.
* Use Step instead of Async.

Version 0.1.3
=============

* Ensure jQuery ready event is called before data event.

Version 0.1.2
=============

* Global ready event is called after all scripts have been loaded,
  this mimics browser behavior (and is more useful).

Version 0.1.1
=============

* Designed for express 3, not compatible with express 2.
* Fully asynchronous.
* Listeners signatures changed to (view, opts) where
  view.window is the current DOM window, and opts is the argument
  given by express 3 to templates.
* Global events: ready, data, render, output
* Settings :
  + app.settings.statics, default value process.cwd() + '/public'

Version 0.0.13
==============

* Fix: buildFragment override has a bug.
* Document 'output' event.

Version 0.0.12
==============

* Fix: fragment is in data, not in compile options. Production.

Version 0.0.11
==============

* Clone documentElement before applying changes. Production.

Version 0.0.10
==============

* Use app.set("view settings").notemplate for global options :
  {
    public : './public/', // the parent of the public javascripts folder
  }
  Render-specific options are still at the same place :
  render(page, {fragment:'body'});


Version 0.0.9
=============

* Add "output" handler type. Called after dom to html conversion.
  Allows changing string output.

Version 0.0.8
=============

* Pretty XHTML output (by using jsdom fork).

Version 0.0.7
=============

* SECURITY
  monkey-patch jQuery so it doesn't download nor run script content when
  they are inserted into DOM.

Version 0.0.6
=============

* Use require.resolve to find path to jquery-browser.

Version 0.0.5
=============

* Use jquery instead of jquip
  since jquery brings its own sizzle engine, we do not need to patch
  jsdom's querySelectorAll.

* Instead of having _merge or merge callbacks, functions are triggered
  by a 'data' event, see README.md.
  Global handlers of 'data' and 'render' events are possible, making it
  possible to define middleware.

Version 0.0.4
=============

* Ensure window.console is the node console global.

Version 0.0.3
=============

* render(view, opts)
  opts.fragment can be a selector, selected nodes outer html will be
  outputed instead of the all document.

Version 0.0.2
=============

* notemplate attribute on script tags can have server,both,client values.
  Default value is client (not loaded).
  The notemplate attribute is removed after template is compiled.
